                    <p><strong>Explanation of Tracking Technologies and Their Purposes</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Behavioural advertising refers to the practice of targeting ads to users based on their online behaviour, such as the websites they visit, the content they view, and the searches they conduct. This allows us to display ads that are more relevant and tailored to individual users' interests.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's device when they visit a website. These files can store various types of information, ranging from user preferences to data used for tracking user behaviour.

                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Session Cookies: These are temporary cookies that are deleted once the user closes their browser. They're often used to remember user actions within a single session.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Persistent Cookies: These cookies remain on the user's device for a set period or until they're manually deleted. They're used to remember user preferences or actions across multiple sessions.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            First-party Cookies: Issued by the website the user is visiting. They often store user preferences or session data for that specific website.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Third-party Cookies: Issued by a different website than the one the user is visiting. They're often used for tracking and advertising purposes across multiple websites.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Opt-out Options for Users</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        If you prefer not to have your online behaviour tracked for advertising purposes, you have several opt-out options:

                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Browser Settings: Most modern browsers allow users to block third-party cookies or all cookies. You can adjust these settings in your browser's privacy options.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ad Network Opt-outs: Platforms like the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) offer opt-out tools for users who do not want their data used for targeted advertising.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do Not Track: Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that sends a signal to websites requesting not to be tracked. While not all websites honour this request, Kaizen Tech respects and adheres to these signals.

                    </h2>
                    <p><strong>Information about Where User Data is Stored and Processed</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Kaizen Tech operates primarily out of Dhaka, Bangladesh, but in the age of digital globalization, data often traverses international borders. Here's where and how we handle your data:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Primary Data Centers: Our primary data storage facilities are located in Bangladesh. This is where the bulk of our user data is stored and processed.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Secondary Storage & Cloud Solutions: To ensure redundancy, better accessibility, and enhanced performance, we might also store data in cloud solutions, which could have data centers in various parts of the world, including the United States, Europe, and Asia.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Third-party Processors: Some of our third-party service providers might process data outside of Bangladesh. This could be due to their operational requirements or the specific services they provide.

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Measures in Place for International Data Transfers</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Given the sensitive nature of personal data, we take international data transfers very seriously and have implemented robust measures to ensure data security and compliance:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Data Protection Agreements: Whenever we engage with third-party service providers that might process data outside of Bangladesh, we ensure that they are bound by data protection agreements. These agreements mandate that the third party maintains data protection standards equivalent to or higher than ours.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Compliance with International Regulations: We strive to ensure that our data transfer practices are compliant with international data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for European residents. This includes ensuring that any international data transfers have appropriate legal safeguards.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Encryption: Any data that is transferred internationally is encrypted during transit. This ensures that even if the data is intercepted, it remains unintelligible and secure.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Standard Contractual Clauses: In the absence of an adequacy decision, we might use standard contractual clauses approved by regulatory authorities to ensure that personal data remains protected even when transferred internationally.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            User Consent: Before transferring personal data internationally, especially in cases where it might be transferred to regions with different data protection standards, we seek explicit user consent.
